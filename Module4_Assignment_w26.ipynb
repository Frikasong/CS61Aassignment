            "**Deans Knight Income Corp. v. Canada**, 2023 SCC 16\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. Facts\n",
            "Deans Knight Income Corporation (formerly Forbes Medi-Tech Inc.) had approximately $90 million in unused non-capital losses, research expenditures, and investment tax credits but lacked sufficient income to utilize these losses. To access these tax attributes, it entered into a complex series of transactions involving a venture capital firm, Matco, including asset transfers, a convertible debenture, and a planned IPO. These transactions effectively transformed Deans Knight into a new entity with a different business, assets, and shareholders, while maintaining the tax benefits associated with the original losses. The Minister reassessed and denied the loss deductions, arguing the transactions constituted abusive tax avoidance under the general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR). The Tax Court found the transactions were tax avoidance but not abusive; the Federal Court of Appeal reversed, concluding the transactions were abusive and thus subject to GAAR application.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3. Issue(s)\n",
            "- Does the application of the GAAR (section 245 of the Income Tax Act) apply to deny Deans Knight’s non-capital loss deductions based on the transactions?\n",
            "- Were the transactions abusive, thereby justifying the application of GAAR to prevent tax avoidance?\n",
            "- Did Matco’s arrangement constitute an acquisition of control that would trigger the restrictions in section 111(5)?\n",
            "\n",
            "### 4. Holding\n",
            "The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, holding that the transactions were abusive and the GAAR applies to deny the loss deductions.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 5. Reasoning\n",
            "**Majority (Wagner C.J. and others):**\n",
            "- The transactions achieved a de facto change in control and corporate identity, circumventing the legislative purpose of section 111(5), which restricts loss carryovers upon control changes unless the same or similar business continues.\n",
            "- The complex arrangement, including restrictions on Newco’s activities and control over directors, effectively gave Matco the benefits of control without formal ownership, thus frustrating the object, spirit, and purpose of section 111(5).\n",
            "- The GAAR is designed to target transactions that, while technically compliant, frustrate the legislative intent by means of abuse. Here, the transactions served to improperly access tax attributes while avoiding the control-based restrictions.\n",
            "- The analysis of object, spirit, and purpose of s. 111(5) reveals its core goal: prevent loss trading through control changes that lack business continuity.\n",
            "- The court emphasizes that the form of the transaction is secondary to its substantive effect—if the result frustrates the legislative purpose, it is abusive.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Dissent (Côté J.):**\n",
            "- The transactions did not constitute an acquisition of control under the de jure control test.\n",
            "- The investment agreement did not give Matco de jure control over Deans Knight.\n",
            "- The purpose of s. 111(5) is to prevent tax benefits from control acquisitions, but here, Matco did not acquire de jure control.\n",
            "- The majority’s approach improperly expands control beyond the statutory language, risking overreach and undermining the principle of respecting Parliament’s specific intent.\n",
            "- The transactions, viewed in light of the statutory language, do not amount to abuse; thus, the loss deductions should be permitted.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 6. Significance\n",
            "This case clarifies the application of the GAAR in the context of corporate control and loss carryovers. It underscores that:\n",
            "- The *object, spirit, and purpose* of specific provisions (like s. 111(5)) are central to abuse analysis.\n",
            "- Transactions that effectively circumvent legislative restrictions, even if they follow formal legal requirements, can be deemed abusive if they frustrate the underlying legislative intent.\n",
            "- The decision emphasizes the importance of analyzing the *substantive economic reality* and *legislative purpose* over mere formal compliance.\n",
            "- It affirms the broad remedial scope of the GAAR to combat sophisticated tax avoidance schemes that undermine the integrity of the tax system, especially in corporate reorganizations involving control and loss utilization.\n",
            "\n",
            "This case is a significant authority on the limits of formalistic control tests and the application of GAAR to complex corporate arrangements designed to access tax attributes while circumventing specific anti-avoidance rules.\n",

        "The prompt engineering for the province extraction was the most interesting part. The first version of the system prompt just said \"extract the province of origin,\" and the model confidently returned wrong answers, it was pulling provinces associated with the judge's career rather than their birthplace. It didn't flag any uncertainty, it just gave a plausible-sounding but incorrect answer.\n",

        "That's a good illustration of a real problem with using LLMs for structured data extraction: they'll fill in an answer even when the information requires careful reading to distinguish between, say, \"born in Nova Scotia\" and \"appointed to a court in New Brunswick.\" The fix was being much more explicit in the prompt, telling the model specifically what *not* to extract (where they studied, practised, or were appointed) and what *to* look for (where they were born or originally from). That kind of precision in the system prompt matters a lot more than people expect.\n",
